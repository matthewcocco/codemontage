  <h5>Code of Conduct</h5>

  		<li>Taking photos of individuals and/or posting their likeness on social media without their permission, implicit or explicit. We admit this one is tricky. We fully support taking photos at the event and sharing them, but please use your best judgement when posting photos of people you do not know.</li>
  	</ul>
  </p>

  <p>Please refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or exclusionary behavior, jokes, or speech both in-person and through digital communications related to CodeMontage projects or events.</p>

  <p><strong>If you are being harassed</strong>, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organizer immediately. Event organizers will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.</p>

  <p><strong>If a participant engages in harassing behavior</strong>, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the event without refund.</p>
